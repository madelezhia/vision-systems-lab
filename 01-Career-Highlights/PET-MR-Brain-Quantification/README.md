# PET-MR Brain Quantification Pipeline

> **Note:** This project was developed for a medical imaging startup under proprietary license. 
> Full source code cannot be shared, but technical approach, architecture, and validation results are documented here.

## 📋 Project Overview

**Timeline:** 2020-2022  
**Role:** R&D Engineer - Technical lead  
**Status:** Successfully deployed, validated across multiple clinical sites  

## 🎯 Business Context

**Challenge:** The company's core product focused on MR-only brain analysis. To expand market 
Reach and address unmet clinical needs, we wanted to add PET imaging quantification capabilities.

**Stakeholders:**
- Clinical neurologists (end users)
- Radiopharmaceutical research partners
- Company leadership (product strategy)

**Constraints:**
- Must achieve clinical-grade accuracy
- Seamless integration with existing MR pipeline
- Multiple PET tracers support (PiB, FMT, FBP, FBB, NAV4694)

## 🔬 Technical Challenge

**Core Problem:** Accurate uptake quantification requires:
1. Precise spatial alignment between PET and MR modalities
2. Consistent anatomical region definition across subjects
3. Robust handling of variable image quality and acquisition protocols

### Key Technical Decisions

Linear registration is an iterative process that uses a 12-parameter affine transformation (3 translations, 3 rotations, 3 scalings, 3 shears) to align the source image globally with the MNI template. Optimization is done by maximizing the likelihood of the tissue segmentation model, comparing the source tissue maps (GM, WM, CSF) to the template tissue probability maps. The optimization is performed using a Gauss-Newton method with a multiresolution scheme: at each iteration, the affine parameters are updated to minimize the sum-of-squared differences between the segmented source tissues and the template priors.

Nonlinear registration is also an iterative, parametric process. The deformation field is represented using cosine basis functions. At each iteration, these coefficients are updated using a regularized Gauss-Newton optimization. The resulting deformation is a smooth, voxelwise field that precisely aligns local anatomical structures with the template MNI space.


### Technology Stack

Core: Python 3.9+ Imaging: NiBabel, SPM12


## 🔬 Validation & Results

### Quantitative Validation

**Dataset:**
- 289 subjects
- 5 different PET tracers (PiB, FMT, FBP, FBB, NAV4694)
- Reference: published results (see References)

**Metrics Achieved:**

Pearson Correlation R² vs published results 

├─ PiB: R² = 1.00 (n=79) 

├─ FMT: R² = 0.96 (n=74) 

├─ FBP: R² = 0.91 (n=46) 

├─ FBB: R² = 0.95 (n=35) 

└─ NAV4694: R² = 0.99 (n=55)



## 🚀 Production & Integration

__Deployment:__

- Integrated into company's flagship software

<!--
## 🎓 Lessons Learned

__What Worked Well:__

1. Early clinical validation → identified edge cases before heavy development
2. Modular pipeline → easy to swap registration backends
3. Extensive automated testing → caught issues before production

__Challenges Overcome:__

1. __PET noise variability: __ Required custom preprocessing per tracer type
   - Solution: Adaptive denoising parameters based on count statistics
1. __MR artifacts: __ Metal dental work caused registration failures
   - Solution: Robust masking + fallback to rigid registration
1. __Speed vs. Accuracy trade-off: __ Initial version too slow (12 min)
   - Solution: GPU acceleration + parameter tuning → 3.2 min

__What I'd Do Differently:__

- Earlier Docker containerization (would have simplified deployment)
- More systematicization of hyperparameter tuning (used ad-hoc approach)
