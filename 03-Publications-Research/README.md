## 🎓 PhD Thesis

**Title:** Modeling, Simulation and Quantification of Vascular Lesions in PET  
**Institution:** Paris-Sud University
**Year:** 2015  
**Field:** Physics / Medical Imaging  

### Abstract
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of mortality in Western countries, and current diagnostic and monitoring techniques are still insufficient. PET imaging with the [18F]-FDG tracer offers a promising tool for evaluating inflammatory atheromatous lesions, but reliable quantification is limited by the Partial Volume Effect (PVE), caused by the mismatch between PET spatial resolution and the small size of arterial lesions. Monte Carlo simulations of 36 lesions showed that commonly used reconstruction parameters—number of iterations, post-filtering, and averaging in the Volume of Interest—can alter measured uptake by factors ranging from 1.5 to 4. Even with advanced modeling of scanner response, reconstructed images still significantly underestimate true SUV values, often by more than 50%, and detection requires at least a fourfold contrast over blood background. While correcting the PVE improves correlation with true tracer concentration and supports monitoring metabolic changes regardless of lesion size, achieving accurate absolute quantification will ultimately require a substantial improvement in PET detector spatial resolution.

### Key Contributions
- Developed high-fidelity simulation pipeline for complex 3D scenes in PET imaging
- Demonstrated significant bias in common 3D quantification methods
- Improved tomographic reconstruction algorithms by incorporating PSF modeling (nearly 10% error reduction)
- Established new best practices for PET quantification in vascular lesions

### Impact
- Highly cited reference work in quantitative PET imaging
- Influenced clinical practice guidelines

## 📚 Peer-Reviewed Publications


**Variability and Uncertainty of 18F-FDG PET Imaging Protocols for Assessing Inflammation in Atherosclerosis: Suggestions for Improvement**  
*Journal of Nuclear Medicine (JNM), 2015*  
**Citations:** 119+ (as of 2025)  

**Key Findings:**
This article significantly contributed to the methodology of cardiovascular molecular imaging by exposing the critical issues of variability and uncertainty in existing 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) protocols used for assessing atherosclerosis inflammation. The research quantified that technical differences, particularly in reconstruction settings (like iterations and post-filtering), could cause measurement variability greater than a factor of three. This systematic lack of standardization limits the ability to compare results between different studies and actively prevents the establishment of large multicentre imaging registries essential for robust clinical trials aiming to track therapeutic effects in atherosclerosis. Furthermore, we emphasized the need to implement advanced techniques, such as Partial Volume Correction (PVC), to properly quantify inflammation or calcification in plaques.

**Impact:**
Academically, this paper was pivotal, serving as primary justification for bodies like the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) Cardiovascular Committee to develop and publish optimized and standardized PET protocols for arterial imaging, thereby facilitating increased reproducibility and wider clinical applicability of this imaging modality.
